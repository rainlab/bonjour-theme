<p>Would you prefer to include the language code in the page URL? It is possible to preset the desired locale by using a URL prefix.</p>

<p>For example: <strong>http://yoursite.com/en</strong></p>

<p>
    You may enable prefixes on your website URLs by enabling the setting via <strong>Settings â†’ Manage Sites</strong>, in combination with the <strong>sitePicker</strong> component.
